## Hi, My Name is Rahul! ðŸ‘‹

As a passionate individual with a keen interest in exploring and unraveling data, committed to driving positive change and impact in the tech landscape.

Driven by the pursuit of uncovering insights and solving data puzzles, I'm always eager to engage in discussions and share knowledge.

Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahulthirumala/)


## About Me: 

As someone deeply fascinated by data, I thrive on uncovering insights and optimizing operations. During my internship, I tackled hospitality data challenges head-on, integrating various sources, automating tasks with Python, developed a novel flow-chart and decesion tree framework to solve the record-linkage problem at Sugamya-Hospitality and crafted visualizations for informed decision-making. I'm also experienced in collaborating with teams and documenting processes. 

Let's connect and work together to achieve impactful results!
